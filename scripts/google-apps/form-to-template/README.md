# Form To Template

After submitting a form to google forms, use the form fields to copy a template file and generate the completed instance of the templates.

Update the consts at the top of the file.

```
From the script: Edit -> Current Project Triggers -> Add Trigger -> `From spreadsheet - On form submit` -> `autoFillGoogleDocFromForm`

On the sheet: Insert -> Drawing -> Add function -> `generateRow`
```
